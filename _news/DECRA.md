I have been awarded with a [Discovery Early Career Research Award (DECRA) starting 2023](https://rms.arc.gov.au/RMS/Report/Download/Report/a3f6be6e-33f7-4fb5-98a6-7526aaa184cf/239). I will be working at Swinburne on transient science and machine learning with [Fink](https://fink-broker.org). I will be soon recruiting students including a PhD!
