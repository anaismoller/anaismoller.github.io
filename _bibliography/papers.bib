        the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we present photometrically
        identified SN Ia samples using multi-band light-curves and host
        galaxy redshifts. For this analysis, we use the photometric
        classification framework SuperNNova (SNN; M{\"o}ller et al.
        2019) trained on realistic DES-like simulations. For reliable
        classification, we process the DES SN programme (DES-SN) data
        and introduce improvements to the classifier architecture,
        obtaining classification accuracies of more than 98 per cent on
        simulations. This is the first SN classification to make use of
        ensemble methods, resulting in more robust samples. Using
        photometry, host galaxy redshifts, and a classification
        probability requirement, we identify 1,863 SNe Ia from which we
        select 1,484 cosmology-grade SNe Ia spanning the redshift range
        of 0.07 < z < 1.14. We find good agreement between the light-
        curve properties of the photometrically-selected sample and
        simulations. Additionally, we create similar SN Ia samples using
        two types of Bayesian Neural Network classifiers that provide
        uncertainties on the classification probabilities. We test the
        feasibility of using these uncertainties as indicators for out-
        of-distribution candidates and model confidence. Finally, we
        discuss the implications of photometric samples and
        classification methods for future surveys such as Vera C. Rubin
        Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).}",

     abstract = "{We describe how the Fink broker early supernova Ia classifier optimizes
        its ML classifications by employing an active learning (AL)
        strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility of implementation of
        such strategies in the current Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)
        public alert data stream. We compare the performance of two AL
        strategies: uncertainty sampling and random sampling. Our
        pipeline consists of 3 stages: feature extraction,
        classification and learning strategy. Starting from an initial
        sample of 10 alerts (5 SN Ia and 5 non-Ia), we let the algorithm
        identify which alert should be added to the training sample. The
        system is allowed to evolve through 300 iterations. Our data set
        consists of 23 840 alerts from the ZTF with confirmed
        classification via cross-match with SIMBAD database and the
        Transient name server (TNS), 1 600 of which were SNe Ia (1 021
        unique objects). The data configuration, after the learning
        cycle was completed, consists of 310 alerts for training and 23
        530 for testing. Averaging over 100 realizations, the classifier
        achieved 89\% purity and 54\% efficiency. From 01/November/2020
        to 31/October/2021 Fink has applied its early supernova Ia
        module to the ZTF stream and communicated promising SN Ia
        candidates to the TNS. From the 535 spectroscopically classified
        Fink candidates, 459 (86\%) were proven to be SNe Ia. Our
        results confirm the effectiveness of active learning strategies
        for guiding the construction of optimal training samples for
        astronomical classifiers. It demonstrates in real data that the
        performance of learning algorithms can be highly improved
        without the need of extra computational resources or
        overwhelmingly large training samples. This is, to our
        knowledge, the first application of AL to real alerts data.}",

        supernovae (SNe Ia) depend on understanding the effects of
        'contamination' from core-collapse and peculiar SN Ia events. We
        employ a rigorous analysis on state-of-the-art simulations of
        photometrically identified SN Ia samples and determine
        cosmological biases due to such 'non-Ia' contamination in the
        Dark Energy Survey (DES) 5-year SN sample. As part of the
        analysis, we test on our DES simulations the performance of
        SuperNNova, a photometric SN classifier based on recurrent
        neural networks. Depending on the choice of non-Ia SN models in
        both the simulated data sample and training sample,
        contamination ranges from 0.8-3.5 \%, with the efficiency of the
        classification from 97.7-99.5 \%. Using the Bayesian Estimation
        Applied to Multiple Species (BEAMS) framework and its extension
        'BEAMS with Bias Correction' (BBC), we produce a redshift-binned
        Hubble diagram marginalised over contamination and corrected for
        selection effects and we use it to constrain the dark energy
        equation-of-state, $w$. Assuming a flat universe with Gaussian
        $\Omega_M$ prior of $0.311\pm0.010$, we show that biases on $w$
        are $<0.008$ when using SuperNNova and accounting for a wide
        range of non-Ia SN models in the simulations. Systematic
        uncertainties associated with contamination are estimated to be
        at most $\sigma_{w, \mathrm{syst}}=0.004$. This compares to an
        expected statistical uncertainty of
        $\sigma_{w,\mathrm{stat}}=0.039$ for the DES-SN sample, thus
        showing that contamination is not a limiting uncertainty in our
        analysis. We also measure biases due to contamination on $w_0$
        and $w_a$ (assuming a flat universe), and find these to be
        $<$0.009 in $w_0$ and $<$0.108 in $w_a$, hence 5 to 10 times
        smaller than the statistical uncertainties expected from the
        DES-SN sample.}",
