**I am a physicist driven to understand the nature of Dark Energy and the nature of transients.**

To maximize the information we can use to understand our Universe, I develop innovative tools with a large emphasis on machine learning.

[Fink](http://fink-broker.org) Principal Investigator and Management team.
Fink empowers transient science in the era of astronomical big data, filtering huge datasets to identify the most promising transients. Fink will process the largest optical survey in the world at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.

[Dark Energy Survey](http://www.darkenergysurvey.org) Supernova cosmology. 
I obtain constraints on the nature of Dark Energy with Type Ia Supernovae and use ML to obtain large SNe Ia samples to study their properties.

[ARC Centre of Excellence for Gravitational Wave Discovery](https://www.ozgrav.org) Associate Investigator. 
I  work on the optical and multi-wavelength follow-up of gravitational waves events.

Member of [Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC LSST)](http://lsst-desc.org), [Transients and Variable Star Collaboration (TVS LSST)](https://lsst-tvssc.github.io), [Informatics and Statistics Science Collaboration for LSST](https://issc.science.lsst.org), [Deeper Wider Faster program](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/centres-groups-clinics/centre-for-astrophysics-supercomputing/our-research/data-intensive-astronomy-software-instrumentation/deeper-wider-faster-program/).
