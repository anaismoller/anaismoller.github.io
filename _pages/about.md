I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Swinburne University Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/centres-groups-clinics/centre-for-astrophysics-supercomputing/) in Australia. I previously worked in France for [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/fr) at [Laboratoire de Physique de Clermont (LPC)](http://clrwww.in2p3.fr), and in Australia at the [Australian National University](https://rsaa.anu.edu.au) as a [CAASTRO  Postdoctoral Fellow in Dark Energy](http://caastro.org).

<!-- My research focuses on transient astronomy, type Ia supernova cosmology and developing novel methods to analyze large astronomical data with machine learning.  -->

Some of my current interests and projects (for more information, see my projects section)
* Preparing for transient astronomy and cosmology with the largest optical survey in the world at the [Vera C. Rubin Observatory](https://www.lsst.org). I am a co-PI of [Fink broker](http://fink-broker.org) selected to process all of Rubin's transient data. 
* I obtain constraints on the nature of Dark Energy with Type Ia supernovae at the [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](http://www.darkenergysurvey.org).
* I study multi-wavelength and messenger fast-transients with the world’s largest collaboration for transient astronomy the [Deeper Wider Faster program](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/centres-groups-clinics/centre-for-astrophysics-supercomputing/our-research/data-intensive-astronomy-software-instrumentation/deeper-wider-faster-program/).
* I work on the optical and multi-wavelength follow-up of gravitational waves events at the [ARC Centre of Excellence for Gravitational Wave Discovery](https://www.ozgrav.org) where I am an Associate Investigator.
* I develop high-end machine learning algorithms for astronomy and cosmology. Including [SuperNNova](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06384).


<!-- I am part of many other collaborations studying transients in our Universe such as: 
- [Deeper Wider Faster program](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/centres-groups-clinics/centre-for-astrophysics-supercomputing/our-research/data-intensive-astronomy-software-instrumentation/deeper-wider-faster-program/)
- Vera C. Rubin Observatory: [Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC LSST)](http://lsst-desc.org), [Transients and Variable Star Collaboration (TVS LSST)](https://lsst-tvssc.github.io) and [Informatics and Statistics Science Collaboration for LSST](https://issc.science.lsst.org).
- the SN group of the [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](http://www.darkenergysurvey.org) and its spectroscopic counterpart [OzDES](http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/ozdes/index.html)
- the photometric [SkyMapper Transient Survey](http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/skymapper/smt/) and SNLS.
- the spectroscopic [ePessto+](http://www.pessto.org).  -->

I was born in Venezuela and did my undergrad at [Simón Bolívar Universidad](http://www.usb.ve). I then moved to France to do the [NPAC  master 2](http://npac.lal.in2p3.fr) and a PhD at [Irfu Cea Saclay](http://irfu.cea.fr/Spp/index.php)  and [Université Paris Diderot](http://www.univ-paris-diderot.fr/). I enjoy communicating science to the general public and was selected to be a [CAASTRO Astronomer in Residence](http://caastro.org/education-and-outreach/uluru-astronomer-in-residence) at Uluru, Australia. I speak spanish, english, french and german. I also ejoy hiking, rock climbing, diving, sailing and playing cello.
