I am driven to understand the nature of Dark Energy and the physics of transients in the Universe. To do so, I work with extremely large astronomical datasets. To maximize the information we can use to understand our Universe, I develop innovative tools with a large emphasis on machine learning.

Research interests:
* I am co-PI of [Fink broker](http://fink-broker.org) which will process, enrich and filter transient data from the largest optical survey in the world at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.
* I obtain constraints on the nature of Dark Energy with Type Ia Supernovae at the [Dark Energy Survey](http://www.darkenergysurvey.org).
* I study multi-wavelength and messenger fast-transients with the world’s largest transient collaboration the [Deeper Wider Faster program](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/centres-groups-clinics/centre-for-astrophysics-supercomputing/our-research/data-intensive-astronomy-software-instrumentation/deeper-wider-faster-program/).
* I am an Associate Investigator at the [ARC Centre of Excellence for Gravitational Wave Discovery](https://www.ozgrav.org) where I  work on the optical and multi-wavelength follow-up of gravitational waves events.
* I develop high-end machine learning algorithms for astronomy and cosmology such as the photometric classification framework [SuperNNova](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06384).

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Swinburne University Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/our-research/access-our-research/find-a-researcher-or-supervisor/researcher-profile/?id=amoller) in Australia. I previously worked for CNRS at Laboratoire de Physique de Clermont (LPC), and at the Australian National University as an ARC CoE CAASTRO Postdoctoral Fellow in Dark Energy.

I was born in Venezuela and did my undergrad at Universidad Simón Bolívar. I then moved to France and did the NPAC master and a PhD at Irfu Cea Saclay and Université Paris Diderot. I enjoy communicating science and was selected to be a CAASTRO Astronomer in Residence at Uluru, Australia. I speak spanish, english, french and german. I also ejoy hiking, rock climbing, diving, sailing and playing cello.
