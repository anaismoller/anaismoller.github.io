I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Swinburne University Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/centres-groups-clinics/centre-for-astrophysics-supercomputing/) in Australia. I previous worked for [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/fr) at [Laboratoire de Physique de Clermont (LPC)](http://clrwww.in2p3.fr), Université Clermont-Auvergne in France and in the [Australian National University](https://rsaa.anu.edu.au) as a [CAASTRO  Postdoctoral Fellow in Dark Energy](http://caastro.org) in the team of Brian Schmidt.

My research focuses on time-domain astronomy and type Ia supernova cosmology and developing novel methods to analyze large astronomical surveys data with machine learning. 

I am a PI of [Fink broker](http://fink-broker.org). [Fink](https://www.lsst.org/scientists/alert-brokers) has been selected to process the Vera C. Rubin Observatory [LSST alert stream](https://www.lsst.org) for its 10-years of operation. Fink will enable transient science in this big data era, including SNe Ia cosmology and beyond!  

I am currently working to obtain constraints on dark energy using type Ia Supernovae with the Dark Energy Survey (DES). I am also an expert on machine learning applications for cosmology and time-domain data. I developed the open-source framework [SuperNNova](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06384) that allows classification of any transient light-curve. I have applied SuperNNova to supernova classification and it is currently being used in [Fink broker](http://fink-broker.org) and DES 5-year data. For more information, take a look at my (research.htmlgeneral research and (projects.htmlcurrent projects page. 

I work with in several time-domain and cosmology surveys searching for transients at different distances and times in our Universe such as : [Deeper Wider Faster program](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/centres-groups-clinics/centre-for-astrophysics-supercomputing/our-research/data-intensive-astronomy-software-instrumentation/deeper-wider-faster-program/), [Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC LSST)](http://lsst-desc.org), (https://lsst-tvssc.github.io) Transients and Variable Star Collaboration (TVS LSST) , the SN group of the (http://www.darkenergysurvey.org) Dark Energy Survey (DES) , its spectroscopic counterpart [OzDES](http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/ozdes/index.html), the photometric [SkyMapper Transient Survey](http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/skymapper/smt/), the spectroscopic [ePessto+](http://www.pessto.org) and the photometric SNLS. As well as the [Informatics and Statistics Science Collaboration for LSST](https://issc.science.lsst.org). With the SkyMapper Transient Survey we launched [Supernova Sighting ](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/skymap/supernova-sighting), a [Zooniverse Project](https://www.zooniverse.org), where citizen scientists joined us in the search for supernovae and other transients. 

I was born in Venezuela and did my undergrad at [Simón Bolívar Universidad](http://www.usb.ve). I then moved to France where I did the [NPAC  master 2](http://npac.lal.in2p3.fr) and a PhD at [Irfu Cea Saclay](http://irfu.cea.fr/Spp/index.php)  and [Université Paris Diderot](http://www.univ-paris-diderot.fr/). I enjoy communicating science to the general public and was selected to be a [CAASTRO Astronomer in Residence](http://caastro.org/education-and-outreach/uluru-astronomer-in-residence) at Uluru, Australia. I speak spanish, english, french and german. I also ejoy hiking, rock climbing, diving, sailing and playing cello.
