**I am a physicist driven to understand the nature of Dark Energy and the nature of transients.**

To maximize the information we can use to understand our Universe, I develop innovative tools with a large emphasis on machine learning.

_ _ _ _ _
* [Fink](http://fink-broker.org) Principal Investigator.
<p>Fink empowers transient science in the era of astronomical big data, filtering huge datasets to identify the most promising transients. Fink will process the largest optical survey in the world at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</p>

* [Dark Energy Survey](http://www.darkenergysurvey.org) Supernova cosmology.
<p> I obtain constraints on the nature of Dark Energy with Type Ia Supernovae and use ML to obtain large SNe Ia samples to study their properties.</p>

* [ARC Centre of Excellence for Gravitational Wave Discovery](https://www.ozgrav.org) Associate Investigator.
<p> I  work on the optical and multi-wavelength follow-up of gravitational waves events.</p>

* Member of [Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC LSST)](http://lsst-desc.org), [Transients and Variable Star Collaboration (TVS LSST)](https://lsst-tvssc.github.io), [Informatics and Statistics Science Collaboration for LSST](https://issc.science.lsst.org), [Deeper Wider Faster program](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/centres-groups-clinics/centre-for-astrophysics-supercomputing/our-research/data-intensive-astronomy-software-instrumentation/deeper-wider-faster-program/).


* [SuperNNova](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06384) lead. <p><small><i class="fab fa-github"></i> <a href="https://github.com/supernnova/supernnova"> @SuperNNova</a></small></p>
<p>Astronomical time-series classifier framework.</p>

<p> Before my ARC DECRA Fellowship, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Swinburne University Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/our-research/access-our-research/find-a-researcher-or-supervisor/researcher-profile/?id=amoller). Before that, I worked for CNRS at Laboratoire de Physique de Clermont (LPC), and at the Australian National University as an ARC CoE CAASTRO Postdoctoral Fellow in Dark Energy.</p>

<p>I was born in Venezuela and did my undergrad at Universidad Simón Bolívar. I then moved to France and did the NPAC master and a PhD at Irfu Cea Saclay and Université Paris Diderot. I enjoy communicating science and was selected to be a CAASTRO Astronomer in Residence at Uluru, Australia. I speak spanish, english, french and german. I also ejoy hiking, rock climbing, diving, sailing and playing cello. </p>
