SuperNNova is an open source photometric classification framework. It does not require feature extraction, is fast and is adaptable to different transients and survey. When trained with large simulations using the observing strategy of a survey, it accurately classifies events and has been applied to data from DES and ZTF.

With SuperNNova I introduced the use of Bayesian Neural Netowrks in supernova classification. We aim to use these networks to quantify uncertainties and use them in astrophysical analyses!
