SuperNNova is an open source photometric classification framework. It uses deep learning Recurrent Neural Networks to classify photometric time-series (light-curves).

It does not require feature extraction, is fast and is adaptable to different transients and survey. When trained with large simulations using the observing strategy of a survey, it accurately classifies events and has been applied to data from the Dark Energy Survey ([publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11142)) and Zwicky Transient Facility ([publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10185)).

With SuperNNova I introduced the use of Bayesian Neural Networks in supernova classification. We aim to use these networks to quantify uncertainties and use them in astrophysical analyses!
