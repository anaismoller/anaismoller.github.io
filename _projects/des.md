The [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](http://www.darkenergysurvey.org) is an international effort to reveal the nature of the mysterious dark energy that is acclerating the expansion of our Universe.

In DES I work with Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), measuring the effect of Dark Energy in the Unviverse, the accelerated cosmic expansion. SNe Ia are very energetic stellar explosions. They are the best “standardizable candles”: objects with reproducible luminosities, used to measure distances in the Universe. Using SN Ia distances, the accelerated expansion of the Universe, driven by the so-called “dark energy”, was discovered and resulted on the Nobel Prize in Physics 2011. 

The Australian counterpart [OzDES](http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/ozdes/index.html) obtains spectra with the biggest optical telescope in Australia, the Anglo-Australian Telescope. In OzDES I obtain anad analayze spectra of supernovae, host-galaxies and AGNs.

I specialize in:
* [Photometrically classified samples (DES5YR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11142) allowing thousands more SNe Ia to be identified and used for cosmology.
* Modelling selection biases to obtain precise constraints on the nature of Dark Energy ([DES3YR](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/abc01b),[DES5YR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10382)).
* Observations at the AAT and spectra analysis with OzDES.
