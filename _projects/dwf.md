[The Deeper Wider Faster program](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/centres-groups-clinics/centre-for-astrophysics-supercomputing/our-research/data-intensive-astronomy-software-instrumentation/deeper-wider-faster-program/) aims to unveil the nature of fast transients in the Universe. Fast transients include some of the most exotic explosions and collisions or mergers in the universe, involving black holes, magnetars, neutron stars, blitzars, extreme novae and supernovae. 

We search for and follow up fast transients (bursts with millisecond-to-hours duration) in real-time. It is the worldâ€™s largest collaboration for transient astronomy with 70 telescopes across all continents and in space!
